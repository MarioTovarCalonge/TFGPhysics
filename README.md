C codes used during my internship. All of them are fully created by me.

SIS codes differs only on the method used for solving the dynamics, Mk uses markov chain's equations and MC uses standard Monte Carlo method for solvind SIS on both single layer and multilayer networks.

IS_SISV codes have the same distinction than before. Both are used for solving my first vacunation model on multilayer networks.

SIR_SISV is only implemented by Monte Carlo method an is used as a more complicated variation of the previous model

It's worth noticing that these are only my base codes so a lot of results I show in my memory are obtained by doing little modifications of these codes. All of them are available. Send me a mesage if you need it.
